 * There is NO code for you to implement here.

 * This file contains a little interface intended to help you test your
 * solution for part 1 manually, by entering movie review information and
 * carrying out operations from the terminal.
 *
 * Using this interface should be part of your process for making sure your
 * assignment solution works well!
 *
 * Once you have a complete solution, it should pass the entire set of
 * tests below.
