 *  - No part of this code may be reproduced without written authorization
 *
 * This is the file where you will be doing most of your work. The
 * functionality you must provide for part 1 of the assignment is described
 * in the handout, and given in detail in the comments at the head of each
 * function below.
 *
 * Plan your work carefully, review the notes for Unit 3, and work carefully
 * to complete the functions in this file. At any point you can bring
 * questions to your TAs or instructors during office hours. But please
 * remember:
 *
 * - You should not post any assignment code on Piazza
 * - You should not share any part of your solution in any form
 * - You should definitely *help* other understand any ideas and
 *   concepts regarding linked lists that you have already mastered,
 *   but being careful not to give away parts of the solution, or
 *   descriptions of how to implement functions below.
 * - If you are not sure whether you can or can not discuss some
 *   particular aspect of the work to be done, remember it's always
 *   safe to talk with your TAs.
 * - Obtaining external 'help' including being given code by an
 *   external party, or being tutored on what to write to solve
 *   the assignment constitutes an academic offence.
 *
 * All tasks to be completed by you are clearly labeled with a
 * TODO:
 * comment block, which also gives you details about what you have to implement.
 * Look carefully and make sure you don't miss a thing!
 *
 * NOTE: This file contains no main() function! you can not compile
 * it on its own to create an executable. It's meant to be used
 * together with A1_driver.c - be sure to read that file carefully
 * to understand how to use the tests there - Any additional tests
 * you want to run on the code below should be added to A1_driver.c
 *
 * Before you even get starter implementing, please complete the
 * student identification section below, and check that you are aware
 * of the policy on academic honesty and plagiarism.
